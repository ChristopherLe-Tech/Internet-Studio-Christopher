    <p>
      The yellow hat represents optimism  and good logical thinking. As a person who always sees the bright side of things, I often think this was to improve morale and boost confidence in myself and others. As every project whether it be group or indivdual, could always use a positive outlook to help achieve its goal in an orderly fashion. No idea is a bad idea.

    <h2>Discussions of the Six Thinking Hats</h2>

    <h3>White Hat – Information</h3>
    <p>
      We talked about what the Lore Atlas Archive actually is as its a website that lets users explore a fictional world through maps, lore entries, and timelines. My partner helped me think about which pages and features were realistic to include for the semester, like a clickable map and short summaries for each region.
    </p>

    <h3>Red Hat – Emotion</h3>
    <p>
      I shared that I felt excited about the project because it combines my love for storytelling and fantasy worlds. My partner said the idea felt creative and immersive, but I also admitted feeling a bit nervous about making the site look as detailed as I imagine it.
    </p>

    <h3>Black Hat – Judgment</h3>
    <p>
    We pointed out that building an interactive map might be challenging with my current coding skills. They also warned that including too many sections could make the site confusing or hard to finish on time.
    </p>

    <h3>Yellow Hat – Optimism</h3>
    <p>
    We both agreed that the project stands out because it’s original and visually engaging. My partner said it could show off creativity and storytelling skills, which could make it memorable for anyone who views it.
    </p>

    <h3>Green Hat – Creativity</h3>
    <p>
    We brainstormed new ideas like adding a timeline of world events or a “character journey” mode that follows one person’s story across the map. These ideas made the project feel more interactive and fun to explore.
    </p>

    <h3>Blue Hat – Management</h3>
    <p>
    We talked about keeping the project organized by focusing on one section of the map at a time. My partner suggested setting small weekly goals to make steady progress and avoid rushing at the end.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
    After the discussion, I decided to simplify the project by starting with just one main region and a few lore entries. I still want it to feel creative and immersive, but now I have a clearer plan and timeline to make it achievable.

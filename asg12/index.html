    <h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      These twelve movies have stuck with me because of their storytelling, visuals,
      characters, and emotional impact. Each one has influenced the way I see the world,
      and this gallery showcases what I love about them most.

  <main class="gallery">

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/Real Steel.jpg" alt="Movie 1">
      <h2>Real Steel</h2>
      <p>A futuristic action drama where a washed-up boxer and his son rebuild their relationship while training a scrappy robot fighter. It’s my favorite underdog stories of all time. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/Kung Fu Panda 2.jpg" alt="Movie 2">
      <h2>Kung Fu Panda 2</h2>
      <p>Po faces a powerful new villain while uncovering the truth about his past. The film is a perfect sequel as it all revolves around him finding his inner peace and how to overcome it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/Interstellar.jpg" alt="Movie 3">
      <h2>Interstellar</h2>
      <p>A team of astronauts travels through a wormhole to save humanity as Earth collapses. I would consider it the magum opus of realistic science fiction. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/21 Jump Street.jpg" alt="Movie 4">
      <h2>21 Jumpstreet</h2>
      <p>A comedy buddy cop movie where two cops go undercover as highschool students to stop a drug ring. It's incredibly funny and stupid, just my kind of humor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/Weathering With You.jpg" alt="Movie 5">
      <h2>Weathering With You</h2>
      <p>A runaway boy meets a girl who can control the weather, and together they face the consequences of her power. It's a visually beautiful story of romance with an amazing soundtrack that I still listen to.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/Guardians of the Galaxy.jpg" alt="Movie 6">
      <h2>Guardians of the Galaxy</h2>
      <p>A group of misfit criminals becomes an unlikely team as they try to stop a cosmic threat. It’s a fun, colorful space adventure full of humor, found family, and great music.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/Rogue One.jpg" alt="Movie 7">
      <h2>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</h2>
      <p>A band of rebels risks everything to steal the Death Star plans. Gritty, emotional, and action-packed, I believed its one of the most grounded and powerful stories in the Star Wars universe. It almost makes me forget its a space oprea Star Wars movie. (PS. Watch Andor too) </p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/Mulan.jpeg" alt="Movie 8">
      <h2>Mulan</h2>
      <p>A young woman disguises herself as a soldier to protect her family and save China. The film celebrates courage, identity, and honor with memorable characters and music. One of my first ever disney movies that I really connected with. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/Your Name.jpg" alt="Movie 9">
      <h2>Your Name</h2>
      <p>An anime about two strangers mysteriously begin swapping bodies and form a deep connection across time. Another visually stunning movie about romance, fate, and longing with another you never met before. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/Pokemon.jpg" alt="Movie 10">
      <h2>Pokémon: The First Movie</h2>
      <p>One of the very first Pokemon movies that tells a story of Ash, Pikachu and friends face the first ever cloned pokemon Mewtwo. The film is what started my love for Pokemon and still to this day. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/Lego Batman.jpg" alt="Movie 11">
      <h2> The Lego Batman Movie </h2>
        <p>A comedic lego movie about the caped crusader, which shows a different side of the batman persona we all grown to know. I believe its one of the best depictions of Batman in recent years. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="movie">
      <img src="images/Kung Fu Hustle.jpg" alt="Movie 12">
      <h2>Kung Fu Hustle</h2>
      <p>A parody chaotic martial-arts comedy where a wannabe gangster gets swept into a battle between masters. It's over the top action is what made me get into martial arts films of the like. </p>

  <h2>Wireframing Questions</h2>

  <h3>What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software?</h3>
  <p>
    Sketching wireframes by hand is quick, flexible, and great for brainstorming ideas before committing to a final design. It helps visualize the layout freely without worrying about technical details. 
    However, sketches can be messy, hard to share digitally, and lack precision when compared to wireframe software. Using digital tools like Figma or UXPin allows for cleaner, more accurate designs and easier collaboration, 
    but it can slow down the early creative process and make small edits feel less spontaneous.

  <h3>Which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why.</h3>
  <p>
    For my webpage project, a low-to-mid fidelity wireframe works best. This style allows me to focus on layout and navigation like how the map, lore entries, and navigation menus connect without spending too much time on colors or visuals yet. 
    Starting simple helps me refine how users will explore the world map and read lore before adding the fantasy-themed visuals later.

	<p>
		Structured content is information organized into clear parts (like title, date, steps), while semantic HTML uses proper tags (like h1, p, ul) to show what each part means.
	</p>
	<p>
		Structured content gives the blueprint for the information, and semantic HTML marks it up so both people and machines can understand it. Together, they make content easy to read, reuse, and display correctly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Having both makes your pages more accessible, helps search engines and voice assistants give accurate answers, and keeps your content useful across websites, devices, and platforms.

		1.) Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?
		</p>

		I think the method “Be bad, very bad” would work best for me because it takes away the pressure to be perfect. As I tend to freeze up if I feel I have to produce something good on the first try, so giving myself permission to be bad would lower the stakes in my mind.
	</p>

		2.) In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?
		</p>
		It’s when you prefer smaller rewards now rather than larger rewards later, even though the later reward is clearly better. Having multiple, spaced deadlines would work best for me, because I tend to procrastionate the tasks until they become too much. Smaller deadlines force me to begin earlier and keep momentum, rather than relying on cramming it in at the last minute.

		3.) Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?
		</p>
		For me I can choose what to share and how to present it, so I have some power in showing the information. I can also connect my work to other sites with links to get my platform to be shown more. The only thing I can't change is how people would view or react to it or if people will click on them since its all human interaction.

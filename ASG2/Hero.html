	<h1>Azrael: Agent of the Order</h1>
	
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	
	<p>
	Azrael is an alias used by multiple fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. 
	The original version, Jean-Paul Valley, was created by Denny O'Neil, Joe Quesada, and Peter Milligan, and debuted in Batman: Sword of 	Azrael #1 (October 1992).
	The second character to assume the alias was Michael Washington Lane, in Azrael: Death's Dark Knight #1 (May 2009). Both iterations 	are Christian vigilantes and assassins created by the Order of St.
	Dumas and its derivatives (i.e the Order of Purity), secretive religious organizations seeking to restore justice to Gotham City 		through religious extremism. They are typically portrayed as antiheroes and reluctant allies of the superhero Batman and the Batman 	Family,
	battling forms of manipulations employed by their respective orders, violent tendencies shaped by tragedies in their life, and proving 	themselves trusted allies to Batman.

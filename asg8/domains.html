      After reviewing the domain names with my classmate, we both agreed that each name fits the fantasy world theme in a different way. 
      Mytherra.com felt mysterious and original, while LoreAtlas.com clearly reflected the mapping aspect of the project. 
      However, we both liked how “Beyond The Realms” sounded the most immersive and adventurous as it gives the sense of exploring vast unknown worlds.

      Out of the three, I chose <strong>BeyondTheRealms.com</strong> as my final pick. 
      It captures the storytelling and exploration focus of my project while being easy to remember and visually appealing as a web address. 
      The phrase also matches the creative tone of the site, inviting visitors to journey into different realms of lore and imagination.

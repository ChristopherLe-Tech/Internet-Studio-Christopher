		The project can connect to the idea of storytelling because it lets users experience the project like a journey instead of just looking at maps and information. By thinking of it as a story, the project focuses more on the user’s path starting with curiosity, exploring different places, and finally learning the history of the world. With the tools at my disposal and how I use them to create a narrative design that explores storytelling, it helps me refine my ideas.

			<h4>Problem:</h4> 
			It’s hard for fans to explore big fictional worlds because the lore is usually spread out across wikis, forums, or random websites. A lot of it is text-heavy and not very fun to explore. So this is to help alleviate from this issue.

			<h4>Audience:</h4> 
			People who love fantasy and sci-fi worlds like gamers, writers, role-players, and anyone who enjoys worldbuilding. They like maps, stories, and interactive ways to dive into details about characters, places, and events.

			<h4>Competition:</h4> 
			Existing platforms like wikis (Fandom, Forgotten Realms Wiki) and worldbuilding tools (World Anvil, Lorekeeper.ai) provide archives of lore, but they often prioritize text over visuals or focus on creator tools rather than fan exploration. Official maps (World of Runeterra, LOTR Map) offer strong visuals but lack community-driven interaction and depth.

			<h4>Key Messages:</h4> 
			It connects maps, timelines, and characters in one place. People can get explored worlds and established lore. 

			<h4>Call to Action:</h4> 
			“Explore the world and add your story.” The site encourages people to click through maps, follow characters, and even share their own ideas, art, or fan stories.

			<h4>How to Measure Success:</h4> 
			Community engagment, foot traffic, personal acomplishment, and critical feedback.

	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p> In the "Evolution of Web" article I've learned that the internet had 3 different stages during its lifetime from WEB 1.0 to WEB 3.0.</p> 
	<p> In the "Wax and the Wane of the Web" article, Its interesting that with a just a few commands and a couple of lines of codes you can essentially make anything as it's easier to start something anew.</p>
	<p> From the "Evolution of Web" article, its fascinating that in WEB 3.0 you can essentially own digital products/Items that is personalized to you.</p>

	<h2>Semester Project</h2>
	<p>One of the ideas I thought about is making a sort of google maps but for a fictional world. I was thinking of using an already existing fantasy world that has established places and setting that can be looked through and learned more about.
	   Or on the opposite spectrum a generated fantasy world that changes everytime so people in tabletop RPGs can use in thier games or quickly use places like towns, cities, buildings that would have pre established lore or story behind them. This will help people get a quick idea for their fantasy setting 		   game that they can use in a pitch. These ideas are still work in progress so subject may change but for the time being this is my idea for a website.</p>
